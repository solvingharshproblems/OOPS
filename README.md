# 💳 C++ Banking System (OOP-Based)

This project is a simple **Banking System** built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries, while demonstrating concepts like **classes**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and (optionally) **file handling**.
